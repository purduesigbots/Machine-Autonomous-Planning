# Machine Autonomous Planner

The **Machine Autonomous Planner**, or **MAP**, is a GUI used to plan out and generate ARMS movement code for autonomous routes use in the VEX Robotics Competition.

## How does MAP work?

MAP allows VRC teams to completely design the movement part of an autonomous route in just a few clicks with an **intuitive graphical interface**. 

Once the user feels done with the route, they can generate the needed ARMS code in a separate file, ready for them to place in their PROS project and tune as needed.

## What is ARMS?

**ARMS** is a template for PROS developed by the Purdue SIGBots software subteam. Its goal is to streamline the development of robot movement code by providing easy-to-use functions for beginner programmers as well as access to odometry and PID control for more advanced teams. More information about how to install and use ARMS can be found [here](https://github.com/purduesigbots/ARMS).
